      <h3>Film Overview</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          In Disney's "Zootopia," audiences are transported to a bustling city inhabited by mammals,
          where animals behave much like humans. The film follows Judy Hopps, a spirited bunny who
          leaves her rural home to pursue her dream of becoming a police officer in the vibrant
          metropolis of Zootopia. Despite graduating at the top of her class, Judy is unfairly
          assigned to parking duty instead of working on important missing mammal cases. Undeterred,
          Judy teams up with a sly fox, Nick Wilde, and together they uncover a sinister plot
          orchestrated by Assistant Mayor Bellwether to turn predators aggressive, aiming to
          manipulate the city's voting and governance.

      <h4>1. Themes of Inclusivity and Determination</h4>
      <article>
        <p>
          Similar to other Disney films, "Zootopia" not only features endearing characters and an
          engaging plot but also prompts deep reflections on the importance of mindset. The movie
          emphasizes the value of accepting everyone, regardless of differences, and advocates for a
          city free from prejudice. It also delivers the powerful message that achieving dreams
          requires perseverance in the face of obstacles and entrenched biases.

      <h4>2. A City of Harmony and Diversity</h4>
      <article>
        <p>
          At first glance, Zootopia appears to be a harmonious city, with different districts like
          the Rainforest District, Tundratown, Sahara Square, and Little Rodentia designed to
          accommodate specific animals' needs and habits. This diversity is highlighted in a scene
          where the exit door of a train features three different sizes to cater to creatures of
          various sizes.

      <h4>3. Addressing Stereotypes and Prejudice</h4>
      <article>
        <p>
          The film cleverly portrays various stereotypes, such as bunnies being carrot farmers and
          sloths working in the Department of Mammal Vehicles. These stereotypes, while initially
          comedic, highlight the struggles each species faces with societal biases and the tendency
          to stereotype one another. For instance, Judy carrying a bottle of fox repellent offends
          her fox friend, Nick, inadvertently showcasing the impact of prejudice.

      <h4>4. Real-World Parallels</h4>
      <article>
        <p>
          In Zootopia, as predators inexplicably become savage, prejudice becomes more evident.
          Scenes such as a bunny mother distancing herself from a tiger on a train reflect
          real-world issues of racial sensitivity. The film turns these real-world racial
          sensitivity issues into a talking point, as illustrated by Judy's observation that while a
          bunny can call another bunny "cute," it's not acceptable when another animal does the
          same.

      <h4>5. Conclusion</h4>
      <article>
        <p>
          In summary, "Zootopia" skillfully weaves together entertaining storytelling with
          thought-provoking themes, making it a must-watch film that resonates with audiences of all
          ages.
