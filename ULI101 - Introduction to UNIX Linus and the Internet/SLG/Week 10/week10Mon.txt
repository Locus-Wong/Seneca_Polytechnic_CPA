WEEK 10 - REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

regular expression - a sequence of characters (literals or special
characters) that define a search pattern.


Filename expansions

? -> indicates a single character
[][! ] -> a sequence of characters
* -> represents zero or more characters


Special characters used in complex regex(regular expressions)
^ -> indicates the beginning of a line
$ -> indicates the end of a line
. -> indicates any single character
[][^] -> a sequence of characters
* -> zero or more occurrences of previous character
	-> a* -> a, aa, aaa
	
what is the difference between *a and a*?

Extended regular expressions -> only allowed with egrep
egrep -> alias for grep -E
{min, max} -> minimum and maximum number of repetitions of the
	previous character
{num} -> num number of repetition of the previous character
{, num} -> up to num number of repetitions of the previous character
{num, } -> the minimum number of repetitions of the previous character

+ -> 1 or more occurrences of the previous character
? -> zero or 1 occurrence of the previous character
() -> groups, groups of characters, a word, a phrase
| -> or operator


Recap on grep options
-i -> ignores case
-v -> inverts the search/match
-w -> exact word
-x -> exact line
-c -> count number of lines that match the pattern
-r -> recursive, when you search through directories
-l -> only displays the file name
