LINK EXERCISE

1. In your home directory, create a directory called week9-link, and move into 
	week9-link

2. Create a file called original-file
3. Using any text editor, add the following lines to original-file
	
	Hard link is a reference to the original file that shares 
	the same inode number. Symbolic link is a reference to the 
	file's path. Symbolic links are also known as soft links and
	are pointers to the original file or directory.	Hard links 
	can be used to create backups of important files, while
	symbolic links can be used to create shortcuts to frequently
	accessed files or directories.

4. Copy original-file and call it original-copy
cp original-file original-copy

5. Create a hard link of original-file called hard-link1
ls original-file hard-link1


6. Create a hard link to hard-link1 called hard-link2
ln hard-link1 hard-link2

7. Create a soft link to original-file called soft-link1
ln -s original-file soft-link1

8. Create a soft link to soft-link1 called soft-link2
ln -s soft-link1 soft-link2

9. Issue a command to view inodes of all files inside your current directory,
	and explain what you have noticed
ls -li 

10. Open hard-link1 with a text editor, and add the following lines.

	Hard links can only be created within the same file system,
	while symbolic links can point to files or directories only
	different file systems.

11. What do you notice of the time stamps of hard linked files vs soft linked?
12. View the contents of all files, one file was not updated, what is it?

Original-copy was not updated. Because it is not linked to the others.

13. Remove original-file
rm original-file

14. Issue ls -il and explain what happened
soft-link1 and soft-link2 become broken links, cannot open them anymore.
hard-link1, hard-link2, original-copy still exist.
