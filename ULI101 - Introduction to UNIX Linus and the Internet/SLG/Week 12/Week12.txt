WEEK 12 - BASH SCRIPTING

SCRIPT: an executable file designed to be run by Unix/Linux shell containing commands.
-> command-line interpreter
-> avoid using already existing commands for your filename.
	e.g. .bash or .sh

Shebang line : #!/bin/bash
-> should always appear on the first line, at the beginning of the script.
-> if it's not at the beginning of the script, it will be ignored and treated as a regular comment.
-> # is the comment
-> it forces the script to run in a specific shell

-> you must give execute permission on that file.
