1. 	I have basic programming experience in C#. 
	And I have studied how to make mobile games using Unity on my own for 1 year.
	Until now, one mobile game is successfully built by myself.

2. 	C text file is a file which has many functions/commands human want their computer to execute. 
	As those functions/commands which use high-level programming language cannot be directly understood by computer,
	they must be compiled to machine code first to let computers understand and then execute.


3. 	I do hope to learn the fundamental knowledge of C language from this course, and try to push myself to median level during my spare time if possible. 
	I will expect I can acquire sufficient help from teacher if needed.
