//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In workshop 9, I focused on reviewing inheritance and the rule of three. This helped me understand how to manage allocated memory properly when copying and assigning derived objects. I also learned how to handle the copying and copy-assigning of the base class in the copy constructor and copy assignment of the derived class.

For the rule of three, I reviewed how to localize common code in a private member function and call that member function from both the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator. I created a private member function called copy in both the base class and derived classes, and implemented the copy logic to its respective private data member.

To manage the base class in the copy constructor and copy assignment of the derived class, I learned to explicitly call the copy assignment of the base class, such as `LibraryItem::operator=(other);`. I also learned to use a member initializer list to call the copy assignment of the base class, like `Book::Book(const Book& other) : LibraryItem(other)`, to properly copy and assign the base part of the derived object.
