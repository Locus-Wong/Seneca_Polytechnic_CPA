Once you have successfully built the directory structure, answer the following questions.
** do not change your current directory unless instructed otherwise **

	mkdir -p midtermReview/{aps145,com101,cpr101,ipc144,uli101} midtermReview/ipc144/{notes,quiz,
	topic,workshop} midtermReview/uli101/{investigation,notes,test,tutorial}


~ -> home directory
/ -> root directory
/home/userid is your home directory
. -> current directory
.. -> parent directory

1.	Change your current directory to test using relative-to-home pathname.
	
	cd ~/midtermReview/uli101/test
	
2.	Change your current directory to ipc144 using absolute pathname.

	cd /home/userid/midtermReview/ipc144

3.	Change your current directory to workshop using relative-to-home pathname.

	cd ~/midtermReview/ipc144/workshop

4.	Change your current directory to tutorial using relative pathname.

	cd ../../uli101/tutorial

5.	In your current directory, create files called week1.txt week2.txt week3.txt week4.txt and week5.txt
	
	touch week{1..5}.txt
	touch week1.txt week2.txt week3.txt week4.txt week5.txt
	
6.	Copy week1.txt and week3.txt from your current directory to workshop directory using 
	relative pathname.
	
	cp week[13].txt ../../ipc144/workshop
	cp week{1,3].txt ../../ipc144/workshop
	cp week1.txt week3.txt ../../ipc144/workshop
	
7.	Create a directory called assignment inside com101 directory, presentation inside aps145 
	directory, and notes inside cpr101 directory in one line of command, using absolute pathname.
	
	mkdir /home/userid/midtermReview/com101/assignment /home/userid/midtermReview/aps145/presentation
	/home/userid/midtermReview/cpr101/notes
	
8.	Move ALL files inside the current directory (tutorial) to topic directory using relative 
	pathname.
	
	mv * ../../ipc144/topic
	
9.	Using chmod symbolic method, give full permission to the user, read only for groups and 
	others on a file week1.txt (inside topic directory) using relative-to-home pathname.
	
	chmod u=rwx,go=r ~/midtermReview/ipc144/topic/week1.txt
	chmod u+rwx,go+r-wx ~/midtermReview ipc144/topic/week1.txt
	
10.	Using chmod symbolic method, add execute permission to the user, remove read from and add
	write to the group members, and remove execute from others for file  week2.txt inside topic 
	directory. Use absolute pathname.
	
	chmod u+x,g-r+w,o-x /home/userid/midtermReview/ipc144/topic/week2.txt
	
11.	Using chmod octal (absolute) method, provide read, write and execute permission for user,
	read only for groups, and write and execute for others for file week3.txt inside topic 
	directory using relative pathname.
	
	chmod 743 ../../ipc144/topic/week3.txt
	octal is in base 8, range 0 ~ 7, uses 3 binary bits
		2^2	2^1	2^0
		4	2	1
		r	w	x

chmod vs umask
chmod is a command used to change the permission values of an existing file/directory
chmod octal values, 777 means
user has full permission
group members have full permission
others have full permission


umask is used to set the default permission values of a newly created files/directories
umask 000
777 vs 666
user, groups, others all have full permission

12.	Using chmod octal (absolute) method, give read permission for user, write permission for 
	groups and execute for others on a file week4.txt inside topic directory. You can use any
